<h1>Cell Type Gene Ontology Sonification Project</h1>

This repository generates a sonification that is based on a gene ontology analysis of single cell RNAseq data of a spinal cord injury. It was developed for the Keynote Vision discussion at the <a href="https://events.houstonmethodist.org/events/center-for-neuroregeneration-third-biennial-patricia-levy-zusman-international-workshop-on-neurorege/event-summary-fc7a37662fdc4e82b9286bb1763bc610.aspx?dvce=1">Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration</a>. It appeared on <a href="https://www.themiamiproject.org/people/faculty/vance-lemmon/">Vance Lemmon</a>'s portion of the panel, which was titled, "A Visualization and debate of what regeneration will look like in 2071". It was developed in consultation with Vance Lemmon, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-choi-11b56376/">James Choi<a/> and <a href="https://www.themiamiproject.org/people/faculty/jae-lee/">Jae K. Lee</a>.

<p>
The sonification takes in four different time points, and the primary gene ontology term expressed by each cell type, which include:
  <ul type=bullet>
    <li>Astrocytes</li>
    <li>Endothelia</li>
    <li>Ependymal</li>
    <li>Fibroblasts</li>
    <li>Macrophages</li>
    <li>Microglia</li>
    <li>Monocytes</li>
    <li>Neurons</li>
    <li>Oligodendrocytes</li>
    <li>OPCs</li>
    <li>Pericytes</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
The time-domain is relative to a spinal chord injury event:
  <ul type=bullet>
    <li>Uninjured</li>
    <li>Day 1 After Injury</li>
    <li>Day 3 After Injury</li>
    <li>Day 7 After Injury</li>
  </ul>
</p>
